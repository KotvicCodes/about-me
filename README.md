# Hey there

I'm Kotviƒç, an aspiring "buttoner" (conventially known as programmer)  
I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript  

I'm mostly interested in web development, or anything that has something to do with JavaScript  
I do not have any kind of job so I'm mostly just messing around on my own, experimenting and learning new stuff  

I'm currently looking for a code buddy or some kind of mentor, somebody who could explain me how to simplify something or help me get through a hard problem, pherhaps I could help somehow too!
