**THIS IS ARCHIVED OLD VERSION OF MY CURRENT ABOUT-ME REPOSITORY KotvicCodes/KotvicCodes, FOR UP TO DATE INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT THE PROPPER REPOSITORY**

# Hey there

## who am I
I'm Kotviƒç, high school student and an aspiring self taught programmer.
So far my stack contains:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I'm mostly interested in novel areas of web development,   
I do not have any kind of job so I'm mostly just messing around on my own, experimenting and learning new stuff  

I'm always looking for code buddy, somebody whom I could discuss programming problems with, brainstorm ideas or help each other out. 

## what I'm working on
I'm currently working on a website called [what2watch](https://what2w.com) which is a Firebase hosted web application which helps you figure out, how does the name suggest, what to watch using recommender system.
You can check it out but as of today it is still in beta version, so you can generate your perfect movie based on random chance for now.

## what have I done
I have already made 2 websites, 1 for an metal festival called [Monster of Metal](https://www.monsterofmetal.cz) which is live and second for a local printing office which has not been published yet.  
I have also made plenty of helpful tool for myself and my friends, such as quadratic equation solver which you can find in [Mathemizer repository](https://github.com/KotvicCodes/Mathemizer).
