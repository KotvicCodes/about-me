# Hey there

### who am I
I'm Kotviƒç, an aspiring "buttoner" (conventially known as programmer)  
I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript  

I'm mostly interested in web development, or anything that has something to do with JavaScript  
I do not have any kind of job so I'm mostly just messing around on my own, experimenting and learning new stuff  

I'm always looking for code buddy, somebody whom I could discuss programming problems with, brainstorm ideas or help each other out. 

## what I'm working on
I'm currently working on a website called [what2watch](https://what2whatch-7b404.firebaseapp.com/) which is a Firebase hosted web application which helps you figure out, how does the name suggest, what to watch.
You can check it out but as of today it is still in beta version, so you can generate your perfect movie based on random chance for now.

## what have I done
I have already made 2 websites, 1 for an metal festival called [Monster of Metal](https://www.monsterofmetal.cz) which is live and second for a local printing office which has not been published yet.  
I have also made plenty of helpful tool for myself and my friends, such as quadratic equation solver which you can find in [Mathemizer repository](https://github.com/KotvicCodes/Mathemizer).

### Remember, you can always message me if you feel like it!
I am not sure if you can message people on GitHub, if not you can always request a pull request.
